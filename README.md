# The Billion-Dollar University
### Overview

[**The Billion-Dollar University**](http://kevinrmccraney.github.io/billion-dollar-university/) is a [d3.js](http://d3js.org)-based visualization of colleges in the US with endowments over a billion dollars. I used [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to scrape some data from Wikipedia, pandas to structure it into a dataframe and do some basic graphing/comparison work, and then visualized it using a pre-made (slightly altered) d3 pattern.

### Technologies Used

* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
* [d3.js](http://d3js.org) (template [here](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607535))
